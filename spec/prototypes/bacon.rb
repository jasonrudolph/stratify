# This file defines an example Stratify collector and activity for testing

# Stratify::Bacon::Activity and Stratify::Bacon::Collector represent a
# (fictitious, unfortunately) service for tracking your bacon-related
# achievements. This also happens to be an *amazing* idea for a service.
# You know you want to track your bacon-related achievements. You just know it.

# Stratify::Bacon::Activity implements all *mandatory* functionality required
# for it to be a valid activity.
